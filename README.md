## Features
1. Uses fuse.js to match search terms in the Beer's Criteria.

2. Uses re-frame and Reagent. re-frame is a Flux implementation that supplies a reactive flow template for structuring a ClojureScript app. Reagent is a ClojureScript React wrapper (and more!) that provides great performance while taking care of view updates as you change your application state.
